Using open data from the Opportunity Insights teamâ€™s Opportunity Atlas to show the social mobility in Baltimore and Seattle in Excel
## Background
With the data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), I compared the social mobility between Baltimore City and Greater Seattle Area. 

Opportunity Atlas contains anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-30s. I chose the average household income, median household income in 1990 and median household income in 2016 to see the growth rate of median household income. I then look at factors that possibly influence the social mobility such as the teenage brith rate, high school graduation rate, college graduation rate and job growth rate in both cities. 

## Conclusion
The following chart shows the median househould income in 1990 and 2016 for Baltimore, Seattle and the nation as a whole. The growth rate for the median household income for Baltimore and Seattle are 1.5% and 19.3% respectively, while the nationwide growth rate is 9.0%. In other words, Seattle has a comparably higher social mobility than Baltimore.

There are several potential factors that affect the social mobility, such as the teenage brith rate, high school graduation rate, college graduation rate and job growth rate in both cities. It shows that Seattle has a lower teenage birth rate, higher school graduation rate, higher college graduation rate, and higher job growth rate. (Shown below)
